    As you are recording and testing, keep in mind that this site is being 
    hosted for free. Therefore, it may be a bit slow.
    
    To start, make sure you are ready with your sounds, then click the grey
    microphone. The microphone should turn green to let you know that you are
    recording. Play at least 3 seconds of your sound, then push the microphone
    again.

    You can then play back your sounds to see if the quality is sufficient,
    if not, click the microphone to record again. Once you are pleased with your
    recording, press *"Evaluate"* to see what genre your song may be and to
    see some recommendations from Spotify.
    
    *Some Notes:*
    - The listening model is only as good as the input, longer is typically 
    better, and less background noise is always appreciated!

    - In addition, because classical and hoerspiel music tends to be at a lower 
    average volumne, if you get either of these and do not think they apply, try 
    playing the song louder.

    - Lastly, be a bit patient, it may run slowly, or break. Just refresh and try again.
